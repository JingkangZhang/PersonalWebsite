# The Router [^0]

When various packets do headlong[^1] delve in[^2],
To the immense network[^3] of links and nodes,
With their companions sweetly do blend in[^3.1],
Each's[^4] secret each in its payload[^5] enfolds.
"O diligent Sir Router" quoth[^6][^7] packets,
"Wherefore detainst thou us here, us[^8] thence bound?"
"Congestions, disconnections, bad circuits[^9][^10],
Which all can me or thy mission[^11] confound.
I shall deliver with my effort best,
As I each of ye do send to next hops;
And if I be with my fit fortune blest,
Thou shalt arrive, nor be thy fellows dropped[^12]."
Thus answered Router our friend[^13] warm and keen,
Who at[^14] next moment crashed, alack, unseen. [^15]

[^0]: Major revision needed. This was among my first sonnets - virtually everything breaks in it.
[^1]: fix stress
[^2]: fix stress: though both monosyllable words, "delve" should be stronger than "in"
[^3]: fix stress
[^3.1]: fix stress
[^4]: fix grammar
[^5]: fix stress
[^6]: grammar error, change to "ask"
[^7]: add a syllable "the" to make a feminine ending
[^8]: "here" and "us": bad "Di-Dum" separated by comma, though wildcard
[^9]: incorrect feminine ending, missing one syllable
[^10]: loose rhyme
[^11]: wrong stress
[^12]: loose rhyme
[^13]: wrong stress, though wildcard. concrete nouns should be "DUM"
[^14]: strange to omit "the"
[^15]: prefer sentences in correct structure: S-V-O

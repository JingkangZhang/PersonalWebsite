Secure, or not secure, that is the question:
Whether ’tis safer on the stack to store       // a stack: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)#Security
The secret passwords of our precious users,
Or to solidify our memory
And with canaries harden it. Tis safe?         // stack canaries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow#Stack_canaries
No more; or by a DEP to say we end             // DEP: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention
The heart-ache and the thousand natural bugs
That C is heir to: ‘tis [1] a consummation
Devoutly to be wish’d. To code, to run;
To run, perchance to crash—ay, there’s the rub:
For in that run of code what bugs may come,
When we have hardened up this legacy,          // the hardening method of providing security is often used on legacy code
Must give us pause—there’s the chance that [2]
Some other bugs bring down our tested app.

RESET’d connections by th'man in the middle,   // tcp reset attack (doesn't have to be MITM): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_reset_attack
The bypass’d firewalls, and the so little
Amount of money that D-DOS can cost,           // DDOS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack
When we ourself might our quietus make
Without concerns for a well-secure’d system?
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But for the dread of some improbable
Attacks, from whose 0-days no one has suffer’d? // zero day: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the speed of our development
Is slowed down with the pale cast of thought, [3]
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action. —Soft you now,
Fair EvanBot!— In thy inspections be            // EvanBot: mascot for Berkeley CS161 (Computer Security) during Sp2020
All my bugs fixed.

[1] the "da DUM" iambic foot is split among two sentences, bad
[2] not pentameter: only has 8 syllables
[3] "pale cast of thought" is properly used in the original text,
but doesn't quite fit here, because it doesn't "slow" anything down.

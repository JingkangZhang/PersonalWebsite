<h2>THE ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>This Poem demonstrates the Connection of Oroonoko, who in his valiant Battel did strive for his “Glorious Liberty” against the “Faithless Christians, whose Gods instructed ’em in Principles so false”, to, Satan, the debated Hero in Paradise Lost through presenting Similarities in Speech, Idea, and Composition via a Sample that combines both Pieces in One.</p>
<p>Professor, who with all thy knowledge rich<br>
Instructs me of the art of reading and<br>
Writing, say how do I in Language foreign<br>
Speak of what I desire, convey what I<br>
Believe, and credibility make in<br>
A difficult form which I’m yet to master?<br>
Or hear’st thou rather Teacher, who appears<br>
Promptly upon the hours to teach me of<br>
Ideas well worthy of expanding on,<br>
When Muse is stifled and perplexed and when<br>
The Holy Spirit is not to be found?<br>
Thee I present now with an article<br>
Bold in conjecture, yet worse in its form,<br>
After the fateful loss of Oroonoko,<br>
Who fought most gallantly for Freedom, to<br>
Perfidious<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> men that enslaved his people:</p>
<p>Thus the white men laid hands on Caesar and<br>
Tuscan, faint with heat and toyl, and bound them<br>
To stakes, and whipt them most deplorably.<br>
O how unlike the contract they proposed!<br>
There the companions of their loss, o'rewhelm'd<br>
With toyl and whips, succumbed to the oppressors<br>
And gave their once respected King and Lord<br>
Most vicious lashes, in hope to excuse<br>
Themselves of their own disobedience and<br>
By whipping Caesar the Revolter to<br>
Revolt against their natural tendency<br>
To be whipped as slaves by white men in reign. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his faint from such inhumane inflictions<br>
Caesar regained his consciousness; though in<br>
Doubt of the truth in his blood-smeared perceptions<br>
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br>
One next himself in Honour, next in Will,<br>
Tuscan. To whom the Captain thus began:</p>
<p>If thou beest he; But O how beat’n! how chang'd<br>
From him, who in the dauntless fight for freedom<br>
didst show his strength: If he Whom mutual league,<br>
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope<br>
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br>
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br>
In equal ruin: onto what stakes tyed and<br>
With what spite whipped, so worthless prov'd again<br>
The Christians with thir promises. Though they<br>
Whip me with force, dethrone me in my right,<br>
Confine my wife and child, yet not for those,<br>
Nor what thir faithless, false God in His rage<br>
Can else inflict, do I submit or change.<br>
Asham’d yet I am in endeavoring <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup><br>
To make those free, who were by Nature Slaves,<br>
Poor wretched Rogues, fit to be us’d as Christians'<br>
Tools; And dogs, treacherous and cowardly,<br>
Fit for such Masters; and they wanted but<br>
To be whipt into th’ knowledge of the Christian<br>
Gods to be th’ vilest of all creeping thing;<br>
That though they fled like dogs abandoning,<br>
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br>
And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br>
And courage never to submit or yield:<br>
And what is else not to be overcome? <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>

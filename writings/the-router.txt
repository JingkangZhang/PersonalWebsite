The Router

When various packets do headlong delve in,
To the immense network of links and nodes,
With their companions sweetly do blend in,
Each's secret each in its payload enfolds.
"O diligent Sir Router" quoth packets,
"Wherefore detainst thou us here, us thence bound?"
"Congestions, disconnections, bad circuits,
Which all can me or thy mission confound.
I shall deliver with my effort best,
As I each of thou do send to next hops;
And if I be with my fit fortune blest,
Thou shalt arrive, nor be thy fellows dropped."
Thus answered Router our friend warm and keen,
Who at next moment crashed, alack, unseen.

The Router

When various packets do headlong delve in,
To the immense network of links and nodes,
With their companions sweetly do blend in,
Each's secret each in its payload enfolds.
"O diligent Sir Router" quoth packets,
"Wherefore detainst thou us here, us thence bound?"
"Congestions, disconnections, bad circuits,
Which all can me or thy mission confound.
I shall deliver with my effort best,
As I each of thou do send to next hops;
And if I be with my fit fortune blest,
Thou shalt arrive, nor be thy fellows dropped."
Thus answered Router our friend warm and keen,
Who at next moment crashed, alack, unseen.

The Router

When various packets do headlong [fix stress] delve in [fix stress: though both monosyllable words, "delve" should be stronger than "in"],
To the immense network [fix stress] of links and nodes,
With their companions sweetly do blend in [fix stress],
Each's[fix grammar] secret each in its payload[stress] enfolds.
"O diligent Sir Router" quoth[grammar error, change to "ask"] [add a syllable "the" to make a feminine endings] packets,
"Wherefore detainst thou us here, us ["here" and "us": bad "Di-Dum" separated by comma, though wildcard] thence bound?"
"Congestions, disconnections, bad circuits [incorrect feminine ending, missing one syllable] [loose rhyme],
Which all can me or thy mission[wrong stress] confound.
I shall deliver with my effort best,
As I each of thou["thou" is singular, change to "ye"] do send to next hops;
And if I be with my fit fortune blest,
Thou shalt arrive, nor be thy fellows dropped." [loose rhyme]
Thus answered Router our friend[wrong stress, though wildcard. concrete nouns should be "DUM"] warm and keen,
Who at [strange to omit "the"] next moment crashed, alack, unseen.

<h1>On Alexander Pope's <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69379/an-essay-on-criticism">An Essay on Criticism</a></h1>
<p>Responding to Pope on his Essay on Criticism has indeed been the most difficult task, for I, wanting wit, fall right into his targeted groups.<br>
I do not dare to write in verse or prose, Lest lack of wit in one or th’ other shows.<br>
Nor do I know whether to create or criticize, for neither receive I the aid of Muse nor the gift to peruse.</p>
<p>As I write wobbling lines with jumbled up beats, my Pegasus dives from the height of Parnassus’ top to meet its oblivion;<br>
When I venture to dethrone renowned poets from their time-tested seats, I make a fool of myself with but ridicule on my partial opinion.</p>
<p>I ofttimes break from the vulgar bounds of ancient times, with great boldness deviate, only to produce grating streams of clashes.<br>
Focusing not on the flow of thoughts but on what rhymes, in search of which I long meditate, I write lines exactly like this one - trashes.</p>
<p>When I judge, I focus on small clips of the authors’ works that I criticize, and only with minor parts of their reasons and styles harmonize.<br>
With a grudge, I read compositions with opinions differing from my own, and with biases blast at the authors with little evidence shown.</p>
<p>Repent thus I today for my past sins; anew present my works as the new day begins.</p>

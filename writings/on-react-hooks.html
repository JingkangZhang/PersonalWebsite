<h1>On React Hooks <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></h1>
<p>From thine unblessed classes thou shalt depart:<br>
For syntax sugar doth thine eyes sweeten,<br>
Yet they are but functions cold to thy heart,<br>
Barriers bitter to unenlightened.<br>
Fear not that this transition be fateful,<br>
For thou of thy new State Hooks canst make use,<br>
And thy components may still be stateful.<br>
None but hatred, if thou makest more excuse.<br>
How to send my requests? Mayst thou well ask.<br>
What in vulgar days when he her did mount,<br>
Effect Hooks, all in one, do sweetly mask.<br>
Or thou mayst complain 'bout old code amount:<br>
Shouldst thou this day manage the transition,<br>
Morrow thou shalt save thyself frustrations.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing and explanations:<br>
You should not use classes any more;<br>
Because although 'class' as syntax sugar can look nice,<br>
It only creates functions(objects) in JavaScript, nothing new,<br>
And poses barriers to new learners.<br>
Don't fear that the transition to Hooks will turn out bad,<br>
Because you can use the new State hooks,<br>
And your component will still be stateful.<br>
If you find more excuse about not using it, you are just hating.<br>
How to send my requests? You may ask.<br>
We used to use the function componentDidMount()<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>,<br>
But now we can use the integrated Effect hooks.<br>
Or you might complain about the amount of old code (written in classes),<br>
But if you make the transition today (to Hooks),<br>
Tomorrow you will save yourself frustrations.</p>

Driver: (while Robert is thinking about Vittoria Vetra) Did you mount her? (&quot;Her&quot; referring to the Eiffel Tower).<br>

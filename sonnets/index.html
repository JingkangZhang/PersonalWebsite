        <h1>Jingkang Zhang's Sonnets</h1>
        <p>A collection of Shakespearean (intended, at least) sonnets written by Jingkang Zhang, mainly on topics around various programming concepts. (LOL what? Sonnets on programming concepts?)</p>
        <p>More sonnets coming soon. (By then this page should look less primitive.)</p>

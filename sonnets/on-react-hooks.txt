On React Hooks

From thine unblessed classes thou shalt depart:
For syntax sugar doth thine eyes sweeten,
Yet they art but functions cold to thy heart,
Barriers bitter to unenlightened.
Fear not that this transition be fateful,
For thou of thy new State Hooks canst make use,
And thy components may still be stateful.
None but hatred, if thou makest more excuse.
How to send my requests? Mayst thou well ask.
What in vulgar days when he her did mount,
Effect Hooks, all in one, do sweetly mask.
Or thou mayst complain 'bout old code amount:
Shouldst thou this day manage the transition,
Morrow thou shalt save thyself frustrations.
